Dental Inventory Management System Analysis
Core Purpose
The project aims to create a system that automatically manages dental supplies inventory based on procedure codes. It connects dental procedures (CDC codes) with required supplies and automatically adjusts inventory levels when procedures are performed.
System Components
1. Procedure Code System

Creates a mock database of dental procedure codes (e.g., D3310 for Root Canal)
Simulates retrieval of these codes and associated metadata
Primary focus is on common dental procedures and their supply requirements

2. Template Management System

Implements a mapping system connecting procedure codes to supply templates
Each template specifies required materials and quantities
Example: Root Canal (D3310) template requires:

2 units of Lidocaine
1 unit of Gutta-percha


Includes admin interface for template management (CRUD operations)

3. Automated Inventory Control

Automatically deducts supplies when procedures are performed
Implements a confirmation workflow:

Procedure selection
Template matching
Inventory verification
Quantity adjustment options
Final deduction confirmation



4. Error Management System

Handles common scenarios:

Unmapped procedure codes
Insufficient inventory
Invalid mappings


Maintains audit logs for all system activities
Includes admin review system for unmapped codes

5. Inventory Monitoring Dashboard

Real-time inventory level visualization
Stock alerts system
Inventory management features:

Manual restocking capability
Usage trend analysis
Low stock warnings



Technical Considerations
Data Flow

User selects procedure code
System retrieves associated template
Inventory check performed
User confirms or adjusts quantities
System updates inventory
Transaction logged

Error Handling Priorities

Stock availability verification
Template validation
Code mapping verification
Audit logging
User notification

Dashboard Requirements

Real-time inventory status
Usage analytics
Alert system
Restock functionality
Trend visualization
